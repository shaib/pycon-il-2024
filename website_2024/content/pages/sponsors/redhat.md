We’re the world’s leading provider of enterprise open source

deliver hardened solutions that make it easier for enterprises to work
across platforms and environments, from the core datacenter to the
network edge.

**Open source is what powers innovation—past, present, and future.**

By operating transparently and responsibly, we continue to be a
catalyst in open source communities, helping to build flexible,
powerful IT infrastructure solutions.

At Red Hat, we believe that our culture is an essential part of our
identity. As an open organization, our culture defines us and
influences how we interact with the world. It is reflected in our
products and services, but also in the way we live, work, and play.

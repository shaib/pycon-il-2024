StarkWare is an Israeli deep-tech company founded in 2018 by academics
and is currently headed by Professor Eli Ben-Sasson, a distinguished
computer scientist and mathematician. StarkWare has succeeded in
solving one of the significant challenges in blockchain technologyâ€”the
issue of scalability. Using StarkWare's technology, a large volume of
transactions can be processed on the blockchain, particularly on
Ethereum and, hopefully, shortly, on Bitcoin. Today, StarkWare employs
more than 180 talents and continues to recruit for software
development positions (backend and full-stack), product managers, and
more.

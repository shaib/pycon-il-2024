Meet our PyCon Israel reviewers! Over the past month, our dedicated
reviewers meticulously evaluated dozens of proposals with keen eyes
and thoughtful consideration. They ensured that the talks selected for
PyCon 2024 are not only interesting and innovative -- but also
showcase Python-powered advancements, aligning with our core values of
community, open-source, and diversity. Their hard work and expertise
are the backbone of our conference. We are immensely grateful for
their commitment and effort.

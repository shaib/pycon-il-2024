PyCon Israel is proud to present the agenda for the 2024 conference.
This agenda is the result of long hours of work -- by the submitters
of proposals which were chosen, and proposals which weren't;
by [reviewers]({filename}/blog/making-pycon/thanks-reviewers.md),
and by the conference team.

The agenda includes an opening panel, 27 talks and five workshops. We
believe it reflects our commitments to excellent content and to the
local community.

Go [check it out]({filename}/pages/schedule.md)! We expect
tickets to be available later this week.
